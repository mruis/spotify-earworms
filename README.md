# Display your Spotify top tracks - "Earworms"

A little toy to display one's Spotify top tracks, which I found having been my
recent earworms. Implemented in React, using
[kauffecup's spotify-react-router-auth][ksr] as the basis, modified heavily
frontend-wise.

## Setup and running

See [Spotify's Getting Started Guide][sgs]. Create your own Spotify application
and put the client id and secret in `server/routes.js`.

Run in dev mode:
$ npm run dev
